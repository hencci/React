// CSS-in-JS is a paradigm for styling front-end projects. It allows you to entirely take control of CSS with JavaScript and extend it with various features.

// Additionally, it also helps to apply styling in a logical fashion, e.g. based on state, and also supports modular CSS in the same way that CSS Modules do.

// There are various CSS-in-JS solutions. One of the most popular ones in the React ecosystem is styled-components.
