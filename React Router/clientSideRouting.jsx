// Client-side routing is the type of routing where JavaScript takes over the duty of handling the routes in an application.

// Client-side routing helps in building single-page applications (SPAs) without refreshing as the user navigates.

// For example, when a user clicks a navbar element, the URL changes and the view of the page is modified accordingly, within the client.
